# Markdown Examples

This document contains notes about how to use markdown.


## Background 

The key at _right_ from letter `p` is used to put a `grey background` on the content we want to remark (right from 'p' + space)

The use of different colours is possible (just in gitHub) if the language is written before the functions and put 3 " ` ".

i.e. javascript:

```javascript 
function sum(a,b) {
    return a+b;
}
```


## Styles

`*word*` = *cursive*

`**word**` = **bold**

`***word***` = ***bold & cursive***

It works with `_` too.


## Links

#### 1. Normal links

`[Description of the link](web page)`

**i.e.** [Link to "Learn the command Line" with Codecadamy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line)

#### 2. Image Links

`![Description of the link](web page)`

**i.e.**

 ![my image](http://jsequeiros.com/sites/default/files/imagen-cachorro-comprimir.jpg?1399003306)

#### 3. Shortcut for links

`ctrl + windows + v` = Link on a word
