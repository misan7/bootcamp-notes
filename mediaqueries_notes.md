# Responsive Web Design

Responsive web design is the practice of building a website **suitable to work on every device** and **every screen size**, no matter how large or small, mobile or desktop. Responsive web design is focused around providing an intuitive and gratifying experience for everyone. Desktop computer and cell phone users alike all benefit from responsive websites.

## Media queries

Media queries were built as an extension to media types commonly found when targeting and including _styles_. Media queries provide the ability to specify different _styles_ for individual browser and device circumstances, the _width_ of the viewport or device _orientation_ for example.

**i.e**

```css
@media all and (min-width: 800px) and (max-width: 1024px)
@media not screen and (color)
@media only screen and (orientation: portrait)
```
