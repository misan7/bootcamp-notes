# Bootstrap, my first framework

It allows to create webpages quickly.

- It is a free front-end framework for faster and easier web development
- It includes HTML and CSS based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, tables, navigation, modals, image carousels and many other, as well as optional JavaScript plugins
- Bootstrap also give us the ability to easily create responsive designs

`cdn` = _content delivery network_; a server where you can download.

## Grid System

Grid is used to define our layout in **12 columns**, how `divs` will _behave_.

Our CSS link has to be loaded the last, after bootstrap and other styles.

#SASS Awesome Style Sheets

CSS Processor; it is a pseudolanguage and we compilate our files before upload to the browser. There are two versions: **SASS** & **SCSS**.

In SASS we don't need to write brackets, just tabs. It's more pro!

We can do thing like:

- `Nesting` selectors
- `&:hover {}` is like a child of.
- Create `vars`
- Create `mixing` = functions that return code @include... `@mixing`
- `placeholders` = `%icon` to run this properties we have to run other classes
- `@import` to compilate all the files from differents folders. To structure all the css. We should write `_` before the file names to avoid the css structure's repeat.
